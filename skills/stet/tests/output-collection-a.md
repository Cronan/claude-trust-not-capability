# Building High-Performance Engineering Teams

Most writing about engineering teams fixates on hiring. Get the right people in the room and everything else follows. In my experience, that gets it roughly half right. I've watched teams of individually brilliant engineers produce mediocre work for months, then seen a few structural changes unlock something that looked like a different organization entirely.

The patterns that matter are less exciting than people want them to be. Consistent communication -- not inspirational communication, just consistent -- does more than almost any other single factor. People who feel safe enough to say "I don't understand this" in a meeting tend to catch problems weeks before they become incidents. And shared tooling practices, the boring stuff nobody wants to maintain, quietly reduce the friction that makes collaboration feel like a chore.

Leadership's job here is mostly about not getting in the way, and then selectively getting in the way at the right moments. The best engineering managers I've worked with spent disproportionate time on onboarding and mentorship, which looked like a poor use of their time in any given week but was obviously the right call over a year. One director I knew blocked her Thursday afternoons entirely for 1:1s with engineers two levels down. Her attrition numbers were half the company average.

There's a version of this that sounds like "just build trust," which is true but not useful advice. The trust that forms between people who have debugged a cascading failure together at 2 AM is qualitatively different from anything you can manufacture in an offsite. You can create conditions for it -- small teams, shared ownership, real consequences -- but you cannot schedule it.

Whether any of this sticks depends on patience that most organizations claim to have and don't. The changes that matter take quarters. Most roadmap cycles measure in weeks.
